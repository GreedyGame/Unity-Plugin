Section 1 
MoPub SDK DEPENDENCY 

If you are enabling MoPub SDK then you need to have the following dependencies
1. mopub-base
2. mopub-sdk-base
3. mopub-sdk-native-static
4. mopub-volley

If your game already has mopub integrated with version above 4.16.1  then you just need to import the GreedyGameunity package and need not follow the rest of this documentation.


If your game doesn't already have a mopub dependency then follow the instructions below.

If play version you are using is 12.0.0 or above then include the mopub librariy aar version 4.20.0 ( 4 aar's which are described above )

Please note here that we assume that you already have play services and the dependencies along with it already in your game. In case you don't please follow the instructions given in the play services readme.


If play version is above 11.0.2 and below 12.0.0 then copy contents inside current-sdk > MopubLibrary  > 4.17.0 to your Plugins > Android > libs folder.
